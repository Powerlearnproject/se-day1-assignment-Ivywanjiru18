Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. Software engineering is important in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication,commerce, healthcare and entertainmet.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
.(a). The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. This marked a pivoted shift in software engineering by altering  how software development teams operate and deliver products.
    (b). The development of programming languages like c, python, c++ and many others.This has enabled programmers to communicate with computers in very efficient ways , paving the path for modern software industry.
    (c) The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements – gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. 
Testing – conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance- providing ongoing support,, updates and enhancements to the software after deployement.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g requirements, design, implementation,) flowing down like a waterfall while the agile methodology is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. Waterfall methodology is used in the government contracts and embedded systems.Agile methodology is used in startups and software consumer developments.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing code, and implementing software solutions.
A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) : software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. For example Visual studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS) : software tools for tracking changes to source code and  coordinating work among team members. For example Git and subversion.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced are technical debt, tight deadlines and changing requirements. Strategies to overcome these challenges are prioritization of tasks, agile methodologies, effective communication and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Types of testing.
(a). Unit testing is testing of individual components or modules of software.
(b) Integration testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
(c) System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.
(d). Acceptance testing is testing the software against the user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
. Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It is important in that it helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific , so the AI understands exactly what you need. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
. A vague prompt is something like; “Tell me about cats. “ And a more precise prompt is “ give examples of the different types of cats according to colour and habitat.” The precise prompt is more effective because it will lead to better AI response.
